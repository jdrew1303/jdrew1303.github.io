# Kreigsspiel (what software development could learn from the Prussians)

## Introduction

Games of strategy are as old as modern civilization itself. In ancient Egypt, a game called seega was played. Greece had petteia, the Romans had latunculi, 6th century India had chaturanga which would go on to be played in China as xiangqi, in Japan as shogi and Western Europe as chess. Most of these games had similar rules. There are opposing pieces that you wish to capture or destroy. In some, all pieces are equal, in others, the pieces have different values. All though have another commonality, they are games of military tactics. A lot of the features of war are removed though and so their use as a learning tool for the aspiring king, queen, or general is limited.

## Ancient Wargaming and Military Tactics

In Prussia, 1824, there was a different type of game being played, kreigsspiel. It involved topographically accurate maps (recently available due to improvements in cartography and printing) and little wooden blocks representing different troop formations. There was an umpire that would referee between two teams (each player on a team would control groups of units and take orders from a team captain). They would also keep track of hits sustained by units (units now had hit points instead of simple kill rules and damage was based on dice rolls and the opposing unit's strength). The last role of the umpire is by far one of the most interesting, they would simulate the fog of war by keeping opposing units' positions secret until they were within visibility range.

## Kreigsspiel and the Prussian Officer Training Corp

The wargames of the ancient world had given way to tools to train upcoming commanders in the art of war, including the unpredictability of war. It became an official tool of the Prussian officer training corp. It was also used as a research tool, to test formulations on the art of war.

## Applying the Principles of Kreigsspiel to Web Application Support

Once a project is released into the wild, development teams are generally expected to support it. This comes in the form of a phone that rings at all hours of the night, or worse, if you're out on the town with friends or family. Generally, little or no training is given in handling these calls, the processes that are in place, actions that need to be taken, or how to handle triage. Add into this the growing complexity of application stacks (microservices, third-party libraries, PaaS, IaaS, message queues, caching, datastores, connection pools, thread pools, SSL errors, unreliable networks, latency) and you end up with a situation where support staff are hopelessly unprepared for production issues.

## The Blue Team and the Red Team

To apply the principles of Kreigsspiel to web application support, we can set up a controlled environment wargaming exercise. The first step is to divide the participants into two teams: the blue team and the red team. The blue team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the web application. The red team represents the external factors that can impact the web application, such as network outages, security breaches, and hardware failures.

## Running a Controlled Environment Wargaming Exercise

To run a controlled environment wargaming exercise, the blue team and the red team should be given specific objectives to achieve. The blue team's objective is to keep the web application running and to minimize the impact of any external factors. The red team's objective is to disrupt the web application and to expose any weaknesses in the blue team's processes or infrastructure.

During the exercise, the red team can simulate network outages, security breaches, and hardware failures,
